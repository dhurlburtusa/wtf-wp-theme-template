/**
 * The template for displaying the sidebar named {name}.
 *
 * Note: These named sidebars don't necessarily have to be located in the site's
 * sidebar region. These can be used as another way to create re-usable content
 * for the site. That is, you don't necessarily have to call `dynamic_sidebar` in
 * this template.
 *
 * For example, consider a "sidebar" named "site_notices". A template file named
 * `sidebar-site_notices.php` could be included in page templates using
 *
 *     <?php get_sidebar( 'site_notices' ); ?>
 *
 * to render the markup for any site notices.
 *
 * There are other alternatives to creating re-usable content. Consider shortcodes,
 * template parts, or widgets too.
